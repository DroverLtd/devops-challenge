For some more detail, check out our press coverage in TechCrunch, Forbes or CityAM.

We want to build ever more extraordinary digital experiences for our users and we need your help: come on board and join our 20-strong engineering team spread across London and Lisbon busy changing the automotive landscape.

## Assignment

Here at Drover we deploy applications all the time and as a `DevOps Engineer` you will have a key role to lead and improve our delivery pipelines.

As part of this assignment we want you to write some [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) modules that deploys a Docker application to a [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) cluster.

The application you are going to deploy can be any one of your choice. Language or and kind of specs are not important at this point.

## What Do We Expect From You?
Your modules needs to be re-usable and organized in a way that they can be extended. Design for growth and rapid prototyping.

## Bonus Points
Nice to have but not a hard requirement:

* **Cost**: Setting up your modules with no waste is highly appreciated.
* **Scale**: What if your application increased the number of allocated resources as the traffic increases?
* **Pipelines**: There are free CI/CD solutions for open source projects. Setting up a pipeline to build your app would be nice.
